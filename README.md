Instructions:

As soon as you type in your nickname and hit "Dolacz" button, you will be added to a new lobby.

The new lobby won't start until these conditions are met:
- 4 players in the lobby
- at least 2 players in the lobby and everyone will toggle on the switch in the top right corner

Toggling the ready switch on will make a player's colour visible.

While the game is started, each player will have time-limitted turns.
If no moves are performed in the specified time, the player is kicked out of the game and will have no possibility of returning.

The turn consists of clicking the picture to the left in order to roll the dice.
After that, a player chooses which pawn he would like to move.
Going out of the home is possible only when a 1 or a 6 is rolled.
Possible moves will blink in white.
If there are no possible moves, next players turn occurs.

Players can stack their pawns, but standing on enemies' pawns will cause them to be moved to the home.

A player wins as soon as they secure every of their pawns in their base.

If you fancy a next game, feel free to refresh the page.
When you refresh the page whilst in-game though, you will be taken to that active one instead!
