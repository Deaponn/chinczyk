        Instructions:<br>
        As soon as you type in your nickname and hit "Dolacz" button, you will be added to a new lobby.<br>
        The new lobby won't start until these conditions are met:<br>
        &rsaquo; 4 players in the lobby<br>
        &rsaquo; at least 2 players in the lobby and everyone will toggle on the switch in the top right corner<br>
        Toggling the ready switch on will make a player's color visible.<br>

                If you wish to test the site for yourself, open second tab in private mode.<br> 
                While the game is started, each player will have time-limited turns.<br>
                If no moves are performed in the specified time, the player is kicked out of the game and will have no possibility of returning.<br>
                The turn consists of clicking the picture to the left in order to roll the dice.<br>
                After that, a player chooses which pawn he would like to move.<br>
                Going out of the home is possible only when a 1 or a 6 is rolled.<br>
                Possible moves will blink in white.<br>
                If there are no possible moves, the next player's turn occurs.<br>
                Players can stack their pawns, but standing on enemies' pawns will cause them to be moved to the home.<br>
                A player wins as soon as they secure every of their pawns in their base.<br>
